var   name = "Yashraj";
let   Name = "Yashraj";
const naMe = "Yashraj";
alert("My name is :" + name);
alert("My name is :" + Name);
alert("My name is :" + naMe);

//Javascript is a case Sensitive-Language
//The variables "name , Name , naMe are three different values"
//All javscript identifiers are case sensitive.


//Lets do some variables test exercise:-

var a = "3";
var b = "8";
//Lets say var a is a sand bucket and var b is water bucket so we need to exchange these materials,so all i have to do is i want an another bucket to fill these materials in it.
 
 var c = a;
 var a = b;
 var b = c;


console.log("The value of a is : " +  a ); //The output is a = 8;
console.log("The value of b is : " +  b );//The output is b = 3;

//Naming and naming convections for javascript variables

var myName = "Yash";
var lastName = "Dandnaik";
var my123 = 12345;
var myvar = "Variable";
var myname = "Yash";
var my_name = "Yash";
var my_name123$ = "Yash";
//camelcase,numbers and underscore and dollar sign is valid for naming convections in javascript
