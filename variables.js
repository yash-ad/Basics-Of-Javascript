var   name = "Yashraj";
let   Name = "Yashraj";

alert("My name is :" + naMe);

//Javascript is a case Sensitive-Language
//The variables "name , Name , naMe are three different values"
//All javscript identifiers are case sensitive.


//Lets do some variables test exercise:-

var a = "3";
var b = "8";
//Lets say var a is a sand bucket and var b is water bucket so we need to exchange these materials,so all i have to do is i want an another bucket to fill these materials in it.
 
 var c = a;
 var a = b;
 var b = c;


console.log("The value of a is :" + a );
console.log("The value of b is :" + b );
