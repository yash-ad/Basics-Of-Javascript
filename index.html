    <div class="Variables">
      <h1>Variables</h1>
    
      <h3>What are variables in javascript?</h3>
      <p>In a programming language ,variables are used to store data values ,Javascript uses the keywords which are Var,Let and Const to declare variables.
        For Example:- 1.Var name = "Yash"; , 2.Let naav = "Yash"; and 3.Const naam = "Yash";
      </p>
       <p>Javascript is a case-sensitive language,All javascript identifiers are case sensitive.
        For example:- 1.var myName = "Yash";
                      2.let myname = "Yash";
                      The variables "myName" and "myname" are both different values.
      
        Javascript programmers tend to use camelCase that starts with a lowerCase character Eg:-firstName,lastName,masterCard
       </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>Javascript defines two types of values which is 1.Fixed values and 2.Variables values
        Fixed values are called literals and variable valiues are called variables.
      </p>
  
  
      <P>What are variables? Varaibles are just containers for storing data values
  always decalre javascript variables with Var,Let and Const keywords.
  
      </P>
  
      <h2>Decalring a javascript Variable</h2>
      <p>creating a variable in javascript is called a declaring a variable.
        Declare a variable with var or the let keyword.
      *After the declaration the variable has no value (Technically its undefined)
      </p>
  
      
      <h2>What is Undefined In Javascript</h2>
      <p>Undefined in javascript is, A variable declared without a value and before execution its undefined,The value will be undefined.</p>
      
      <h2>What is Not-defined In Javascript</h2>
      <p>Not-defined in javascript is the value has nit stored in a memory since it not-defined</p>
  
  
  
      
      <p>You cannot redeclare a variable with Let and Const keywords
        If you put a numbers in quotes "",the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings and concatenated.
        Since javascript treats a dollar sign as a letter,Identifiers containing are valid names and Underscore_ as well.
      </p>
  
  
  <h1>Lets dive deep into Javascript keywords</h1>
  <p>The let keyword was intorduced in ES6(2015),the let keyword cannot be redeclared,the let keyowrd have {Block-Scope}
    For example :- Let myName = "Yash";
    <p>Redeclaring a variable using <emp>let</emp> keyword inside a {Block} cannot be redeclared a variable outside the block
      Variables are defined with the let keyword are hoisted to the top however it cannot be intialized.
       Using a let keyword before its declared will result in a  referneceerror.
       Redecalring a variable using let keyword in the same block is not allowed and in the  another block is allowed
      </p>
  <p>Redeclaring a variable using <emp>Var</emp> keyword inside a {Block} will also redeclare the variable outside the block.
    Redeclaring a variable using var is allowed anywhere in the program
  </p>
  
  
  <h1> Javascript Const </h1>
  <p>The const keyword was intorduced in ES6(2015),
    Variables are defined with the const cannot be redeclared and it cannot be reassigned.
    variables define with the const have block scope, Javascript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3> When to use Javascript-Const </h3>
  <p>A javascript const can be used when you know the value cannot be changed that means it will remain fixed.
    For Example:- Const Nature = "Fixed Universe";
  
    Use const when you declare 
    A new array , A new object , A new function , A new Regexp
  </p>
  
  
  <h3> Const Object and Arrays </h3>
  <p>The keyword Const is a little confusing and misleading.
    it does not define a constant value , however it defines a constant reference to a value.
    Because of the reasons,You cannot reassign a constant value,You cannot reassign a constant array or You cannot reassign a constant object 
    But of course you can change the elements of constant array [] and the properties of constant object {}.
  
  </p>
  
  <p>When it comes to declaring a variable with the const is similar to let both are Block-Scope
  const x = 10;
  {
    const x = 2;
  }
  //Here the value of x is 10; Because the value of x is fixed and declared outside of the block as well.
  and the x declared inside a block is not the same as outside the block.
  </p>
  
  <p>Redeclaring a variable in javascript with the var keyword is anywhere allowed in the program.
    Redeclaring an existing "Var" or "Let" variable to const in the same scope is not allowed
  </p>
  
  <h3>Javascript Keywords</h3>
  <p>Var,Let,Const,if,switch,for,function,return,try and javascript statements are often start with a keyword to identify the javascript action to be performed.</p>
  
  
  <h1>Javascript programs</h1>
  <p>
    A computer program is a list of instructions to be executed by a computer
    and Javascript program is a list of programming statements.
  </p>
  
  <br>
  
  <h2> What is a Javascript statements </h2>
  <p>In a programming language the list of instructions are called statements.</p>
  <p>Javascript statements are composed of Values,Operators,Expression,Keywords and Comments.</p>
  <p>Javascript programs contain many javascript statements and these statements are executed one by one , in the same order as they are written.
    Javascript programs(and javascript statements) are often called javascript code.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Javascript expresssions</h3>
  <p>An expression is a combination of values,variables and operators , which computes to a value.</p>
  for Example:-
  5 + 10 = 15;
  
  The computation is called an evaluation.
  
  
  <h1>Hoisting In Javascript:-</h1>
  <strong>What is hoisting in javascript?</strong>
  <p>Hoisting in javascript is behaviour to moving declarations of functions,variables and classes to top of their scope ,prior to execution of the code.however the concept of hoisting in javascript is due to the compilaton process start that happens before javascript program starts executing
    infact what happens instead the variable and functions declaration are put unto memory during the compile phase and hoisting is relation to the memory management.
  
  </p>
  <h1>What is Temporal dead zone?</h1>
  <p>First it is a behaviour of javascript, whenever we access the let or const variable before the declaration "The reference error" will be in the output however with Var , you will get "Undefined" in the output.
  
  <ul>
    <li>Type of TDZ for let or const : ReferneceError 
  
    </li>
    <li>Type of TDZ for Var : Undefined 
  
    </li>
  
  
  </ul>
  
  
  </p>
  
    </div>


    <div class="Datatypes">
      <h1>What are Datatypes in javascript?</h1>
      <p> A datatype , in programming is a classification that specifies which type of a value variable has and what type of mathematical , realtional or logical operations can be applied or used to it without causing an error. </p>
<h2>Primitive Data-Types</h2>
<p>There are Seven types of primitive datatypes in javascript</p>
<ul>
  <li>String</li>
  <p>IN javascript text values are known as The string Data-type.</p>
  <li>Number</li>
  <p>While numerical values are referred to asTthe numbers Data-type.</p>
  <li>Boolean</li>
  <p>The bollean data-type has only two values , True or False.</p>
  <li>Null</li>
  <p>The null data-type is the absence of a value.</p>
  <li>Undefined</li>
  <p>Undefined data-type usually refers to a variable that has bot yet been assigned a value.</p>
  <li>BigInt</li>
  <p>Bunch of numbers </p>
  <li>Symbol</li>
  <p>Which is used is an unique identifier</p>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Non-Primitive Data-types</h2>
<p> -n types that means in a reference type will keep increasing </p>
<ul>
    <li>Object</li>
    <li>Arrays</li>
    <li>Sets</li>
</ul>

<p>Javascript types are dynamic which means that same variable can be used to hold different datatypes.</p>
      
<p>Javascript evaluates the expression from left to right.</p>

<p>Javascript BigInt , All javascript numbers are stored in 64bit floating point.one type double</p>

<h3>Javascript Arrays</h3>
<p>Javascript Arrays are written with [Square Bracket] and are seperated by commas
  Arrays indexes are zero based , which means first item is 0 and second item is 1 and so on.
</p>

<h3>Javascript Objects</h3>
<p>Javascript Objects are written with {Curly Braces} and with the properties Name:value pairs and are seperated by commas</p>



</div>

<div class="Type-Conversion">
<h1>Type conversion</h1>
<h2>Whats is javascript Type-Conversion?</h2>
<p>Javascript variable can be converted to a new variable and another data type.</p>
<p>Number(),String(),Boolean()
  <ul>
  <li>Javascript consdiers 0 as False and all non-zero as True , and if True is converted to a number the result is always 1.
  </li>
  <li>String()Takes null and undefined and convert them into string </li>
<li>In javascript null,undefined,Nan,0 converts to false. and all other values give true.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Converting Strings To Numbers</h2>
<p>1.The global method Number() converts a variable(or a value) into a number.
2.Empty string like "" converts to 0.
3.Non-Numeric strings like "String" conerts to Nan(Not a number).
4.A numeric string like "3.14" it converts to a number like 3.14

</p>

<h3>The unary [+] Operator </h3>
<p>The unary + operator can be used to convert a variable to a number.
  lets take an example:- 
  let y = "31";
  let z = + y;
console.log(z); //The answer is 31 that converted string to a number because of unary + Operator
</p>
