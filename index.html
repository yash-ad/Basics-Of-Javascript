    <h1>Variables</h1>
    
    <h3>What are variables in javascript?</h3>
    <p>In a programming language ,variables are used to store data values ,Javascript uses the keywords which are Var,Let and Const to declare variables.
      For Example:- 1.Var name = "Yash"; , 2.Let naav = "Yash"; and 3.Const naam = "Yash";
    </p>
     <p>Javascript is a case-sensitive language,All javascript identifiers are case sensitive.
      For example:- 1.var myName = "Yash";
                    2.let myname = "Yash";
                    The variables "myName" and "myname" are both different values.
    
      Javascript programmers tend to use camelCase that starts with a lowerCase character Eg:-firstName,lastName,masterCard
     </p>
    
    
    
    
    <p>Javascript defines two types of values which is 1.Fixed values and 2.Variables values
      Fixed values are called literals and variable valiues are called variables.
    </p>


    <P>What are variables? Varaibles are just containers for storing data values
always decalre javascript variables with Var,Let and Const keywords.

    </P>

    <h2>Decalring a javascript Variable</h2>
    <p>creating a variable in javascript is called a declaring a variable.
      Declare a variable with var or the let keyword.
    *After the declaration the variable has no value (Technically its undefined)
    </p>

    
    <h2>What is Undefined In Javascript</h2>
    <p>Undefined in javascript is, A variable declared without a value and before execution its undefined,The value will be undefined.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Not-defined In Javascript</h2>
    <p>Not-defined in javascript is the value has nit stored in a memory since it not-defined</p>



    
    <p>You cannot redeclare a variable with Let and Const keywords
      If you put a numbers in quotes "",the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings and concatenated.
      Since javascript treats a dollar sign as a letter,Identifiers containing are valid names and Underscore_ as well.
    </p>


<h1>Lets dive deep into Javascript keywords</h1>
<p>The let keyword was intorduced in ES6(2015),the let keyword cannot be redeclared,the let keyowrd have {Block-Scope}
  For example :- Let myName = "Yash";
  <p>Redeclaring a variable using <emp>let</emp> keyword inside a {Block} cannot be redeclared a variable outside the block
    Variables are defined with the let keyword are hoisted to the top however it cannot be intialized.
     Using a let keyword before its declared will result in a  referneceerror.
     Redecalring a variable using let keyword in the same block is not allowed and in the  another block is allowed
    </p>
<p>Redeclaring a variable using <emp>Var</emp> keyword inside a {Block} will also redeclare the variable outside the block.
  Redeclaring a variable using var is allowed anywhere in the program
</p>


<h1> Javascript Const </h1>
<p>The const keyword was intorduced in ES6(2015),
  Variables are defined with the const cannot be redeclared and it cannot be reassigned.
  variables define with the const have block scope, Javascript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared.
</p>


<h3> When to use Javascript-Const </h3>
<p>A javascript const can be used when you know the value cannot be changed that means it will remain fixed.
  For Example:- Const Nature = "Fixed Universe";

  Use const when you declare 
  A new array , A new object , A new function , A new Regexp
</p>


<h3> Const Object and Arrays </h3>
<p></p>


























<h3>Javascript Keywords</h3>
<p>Var,Let,Const,if,switch,for,function,return,try and javascript statements are often start with a keyword to identify the javascript action to be performed.</p>


<h1>Javascript programs</h1>
<p>
  A computer program is a list of instructions to be executed by a computer
  and Javascript program is a list of programming statements.
</p>

<br>

<h1> What is a Javascript statements </h1>
<p>In a programming lagauage the list of instructions are called statements.</p>
<p>Javascript statements are composed of Values,Operators,Expression,Keywords and Comments.</p>
<p>Javascript programs contain many javascript statements and these statements are executed one by one , in the same order as they are written.
  Javascript programs(and javascript statements) are often called javascript code
</p>

<h1>Javascript expresssions</h1>
<p>An expression is a combination of values,variables and operators , which computes to a value.</p>
for Example:-
5 + 10 = 15;

The computation is called an evaluation.





































    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    
    
    <h3>1.String</h3>
    <p>Its simply a string of characters,In javascript are known as the string data type.The string must be enclosed in either single or double quotes
  A string in javascript must be surrounded by quotes  
</p>    

<P> In javascript there are three types of quotes
1.Single Quotes  'Hello-World'
2.Double Quotes  "Hello-World"
3.Backticks     `Hello-World`
</P>

<p>Double and single quotes are SIMPLE quotes there is practically no difference between them in javascript</p>

<p>Backticks are exteneded functionality quotes they allow us to embed variables and expresssions intpo a string by wrapping.</p>

<p>In javascript the textual data is stored as a string and there is no seperate type for a single character</p>

<p>We should be aware that strings in javascript are encoded using UTF-16.that is each character has a coressponduing numeric code</p>



<h3>2.Numbers</h3>


<p>While numerical values are referrred to as the numbers Data-Type</p>


<p>However there are additional data types in javascript</p>
