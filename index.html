    <h1>Variables</h1>
    
    <h3>What are variables in javascript?</h3>
    <p>In a programming language ,variables are used to store data values ,Javascript uses the keywords which are Var,Let and Const to declare variables.
      For Example:- 1.Var name = "Yash"; , 2.Let naav = "Yash"; and 3.Const naam = "Yash";
    </p>
     <p>Javascript is a case-sensitive language,All javascript identifiers are case sensitive.
      For example:- 1.var myName = "Yash";
                    2.let myname = "Yash";
                    The variables "myName" and "myname" are both different values.
    
      Javascript programmers tend to use camelCase that starts with a lowerCase character Eg:-firstName,lastName,masterCard
     </p>
    
    
    
    
    <p>Javascript defines two types of values which is 1.Fixed values and 2.Variables values
      Fixed values are called literals and variable valiues are called variables.
    </p>


    <P>What are variables? Varaibles are just containers for storing data values
always decalre javascript variables with Var,Let and Const keywords.

    </P>

    <h2>Decalring a javascript Variable</h2>
    <p>creating a variable in javascript is called a declaring a variable.
      Declare a variable with var or the let keyword.
    *After the declaration the variable has no value (Technically its undefined)
    </p>


    <h2>What is Undefined In Javascript</h2>
    <p>Undefined in javascript is, A variable declared without a value and before execution its undefined,The value will be undefined.</p>

<p>You cannot redeclare a variable with Let and Const keywords
  If you put a numbers
</p>












































    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    
    
    <h3>1.String</h3>
    <p>Its simply a string of characters,In javascript are known as the string data type.The string must be enclosed in either single or double quotes
  A string in javascript must be surrounded by quotes  
</p>    

<P> In javascript there are three types of quotes
1.Single Quotes  'Hello-World'
2.Double Quotes  "Hello-World"
3.Backticks     `Hello-World`
</P>

<p>Double and single quotes are SIMPLE quotes there is practically no difference between them in javascript</p>

<p>Backticks are exteneded functionality quotes they allow us to embed variables and expresssions intpo a string by wrapping.</p>

<p>In javascript the textual data is stored as a string and there is no seperate type for a single character</p>

<p>We should be aware that strings in javascript are encoded using UTF-16.that is each character has a coressponduing numeric code</p>



<h3>2.Numbers</h3>


<p>While numerical values are referrred to as the numbers Data-Type</p>


<p>However there are additional data types in javascript</p>
