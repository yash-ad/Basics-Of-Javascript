    <h1>What are Opeartors in Javascript?</h1>
    <p>In Javascript operators is a special symbol are used to perform an operations between operands (Values and variables).</p>
    
    <h2>What are operators and operand?</h2>
    <p>
    In Javascript operators means that the operation between numbers or variables.
    In Javascript operand means that the arithmetic numbers to perform and operation between operator.

    </p>

<ol>
    <li>Javascript Arithmetic operators </li>
    <p>Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations.
        + Addition , - Subtraction , * Multiplication , / Division , % Modulus , ++ Increment , --Decrement
    </p>
<li>Javascript Assignment operators </li>
<p>Assignment operators are used to perform assign values to variables.
    = (Assignment operator) , += (Addition assignment) , -= (Subtraction assignment) , *= (Multiplication assignment) , /= (Division assignment) , %= (Remainder assignment) , **= (Exponentiation assignment)
</p>
<li>Javascript Comparison operators </li>
<p>Comparison operators are used to compare the values and return a boolean value , either true or false. 
and comparison operators are also used in conditional statements to compare values.
1. Equal to ==             (Returns True if the operands are Equal.)
2. Strict Equal to ===     (Returns True if the operands are Equal and same type.)
Mostly recommend === to remove errors.
3. Not Equal to !=         (Returns true if the operands are not equal.)
3. Strict not equal to !== (Returns true if the operands are not equal and same type.)
4. Greater than >          (Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.)
5. Less than <             (Returns True if the left operand is less than the right operand.)
6. Greater than or Equal to >= (Returns True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.)
7. Less than or equal to <= (Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.)
</p>

<li>Javascript Logical operators</li>
<p>Logical operators are used to perform some logical operations between variables or values and it returns boolean value either Trur or False.
1.Logical AND && operators (It returns True if both the value are on its right or left evaluated to true. or else flase.)
    console.log(true && true) will output: true 

    console.log(true && false) will output: false 
    
    console.log(false && true) will output: false 
    
    console.log(false && false) will output: false

2. Logical || OR operators (It returns true when atleast  one of the given comparison are evaluates to true.)
console.log(true || true) will output: true 

console.log(true || false) will output: true  

console.log(false || true) will output: true  

console.log(false || false) will output: false

3. Logical NOT ! operators (it returns and flips the value that means From true to false and from false to true)
You can think of the ! operator as a switch, which flips the evaluated boolean value from true to false and from false to true.

console.log(true || true) will output: false. 

console.log(false || false) will output: true.
